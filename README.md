# Local RAG Chatbot

🚧 **Coming Soon** 🚧

Local RAG Chatbot is a fully local, context-aware chatbot designed to answer generic factual and arithmetic questions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system runs entirely offline with open-source language models and locally ingested open knowledge sources such as Wikipedia, enabling accurate and up-to-date answers without relying on paid APIs or live web access. It supports multi-turn conversations with contextual follow-up questions, provides an explicit command to forget all previous context, and focuses strictly on factual question answering without code, image, or media generation. The project emphasizes simplicity, effectiveness, and reproducibility.
